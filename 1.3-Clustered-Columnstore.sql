    Clustered Columnstore indexes can make a dramatic difference and are the technology
    used to optimize real-time analytics. They can achieve an order of magnitude
    performance gain over a normal row table, a dramatic compression of the data,
    and minimize interference with real-time transaction processing.

    A columnstore has rows and columns, but the data is stored in a column format.
